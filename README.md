# I'm Uber
The project of the course: "Cloud Native Development: towards Best Practice"

## User Story
* As a passenger, I want to know when I can arrive at the destination (TSMC). So that I can make sure I won't be late for work.
  * When the passenger enters the destination, system provides the driver with the estimated arrival time and the time of arrival at the destination.
  * When passenger is on the way, system provides a map with current location and estimated arrival time.

* As a driver, I want to know if picking up the passenger will involve taking a detour. So that I won't be waste fuel and time.
  * When the system matches the driver and the passenger, the driver's interface displays the received fuel subsidy (pay for passenger) and the location of the passenger.
  * When the passenger it's not on the way, the driver can refuse to pick up the passenger within the designated time.
